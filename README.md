# Hyprdots

Welcome to **Hyprdots**, a personal and evolving project dedicated to creating a visually captivating, highly customizable, and minimalistic dotfiles setup for the **Hyprland** window manager on Arch Linux. This repository is my creative space, where I experiment with aesthetic themes, fluid animations, and functional widgets to craft a unique desktop experience.

> **Note**: This project is under active development. Expect regular updates, new features, and occasional tweaks as I refine the setup. This is a personal project tailored to my workflow and aesthetic preferences, but feel free to explore, adapt, or contribute ideas!

## Project Status

Hyprdots is a **work-in-progress** and reflects my personal vision for a dream desktop setup. While functional, some features may be experimental, and configurations are subject to change. I’m constantly exploring new ways to enhance the experience, so expect updates to themes, widgets, and scripts as I iterate.

This is a **personal project**, meaning it’s tailored to my preferences and workflow. However, the modular structure makes it adaptable for anyone looking to customize their Hyprland setup. Contributions or suggestions are welcome, but please keep in mind that this is primarily my creative outlet.
